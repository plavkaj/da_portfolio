### 📂 Portfolio Projects

#### [1. Sales Performance & Commission Simulator](01_Retail_Sales_Performance/)
**Goal:** Analyze 2 years of retail transaction data to evaluate sales trends and simulate the financial impact of a new commission scheme (5% of Margin).

* **Business Problem:** The company needed to move from static Excel reporting to dynamic monitoring and required a financial simulation for a proposed bonus structure.
* **Key Tech:**
    * **SQL:** Strict ETL pipeline, data cleaning (handling nulls, cancellations), and type casting.
    * **Power BI:** DAX measures for financial logic (`Estimated Margin`, `Commission Bonus`) and interactive dashboards.
* **Outcome:** Identified Top 3 export markets (EIRE, Netherlands, Germany) and validated that the new commission scheme costs ~1.5% of total revenue.
